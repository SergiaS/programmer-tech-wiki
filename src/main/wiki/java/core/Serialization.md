# Serialization
* [Serialization and Deserialization in JAVA](https://prashant007.medium.com/serialization-and-deserialization-in-java-ce3fe636da88)
  
Serialization is the way to transform objects into a byte stream.

Deserialization is the just opposite of what serialization does, convert byte streams to the object.

Important points to note about Serialization:
1. `static` fields in a class donâ€™t serialize.
2. `transient` keyword is used to make field ignore while serializing ( these will take default value).
3. When a class implements a Serializable interface, all its subclasses are serializable as well. 
   When an object has a reference to another object, these objects must implement the serializable interface, or else `NotSerializableException` will be thrown.
5. If one of the fields in a serializable object consists of an array of objects, then all these objects must be serializable as well, or else a `NotSerializableException` will be thrown.
