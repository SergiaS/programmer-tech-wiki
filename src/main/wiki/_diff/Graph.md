# Graph / Графы
Графы используются для моделирования связей между разными объектами.

A graph is a data structure for storing connected data like a network of people on a social media platform.

A graph consists of vertices and edges. A vertex represents the entity (for example, people) and an edge represents the relationship between entities (for example, a person's friendships).

# Graph in Java
Java doesn't have a default implementation of the graph data structure.

However, we can implement the graph using Java Collections.

A graph is nothing but a collection of vertices and edges which can be represented as either an __adjacency matrix__ or an __adjacency list__.


> There are two possible ways to traverse a graph, depth-first traversal and breadth-first traversal.
